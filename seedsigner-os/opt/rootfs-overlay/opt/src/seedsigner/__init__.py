"""SeedSigner package initialisation.

This module ensures that the Python ``hashlib`` library has support for the
``ripemd160`` hash algorithm.  Some minimal Python environments – such as the
one used in the SeedSigner OS image – are built against an OpenSSL library that
omits RIPEMD160.  Downstream libraries (e.g. ``pysatochip`` and ``embit``)
expect ``hashlib.new('ripemd160')`` to be available and will raise a
``ValueError`` otherwise which manifests in the UI as
"Unsupported hash type ripemd160".

To make the behaviour consistent across platforms we try to create the hash and
if it fails we patch ``hashlib.new`` to delegate RIPEMD160 to PyCryptodome's
implementation.  This keeps the rest of the codebase unchanged and fixes the
signing and xpub export flows for Satochip cards on the stripped-down system
image.
