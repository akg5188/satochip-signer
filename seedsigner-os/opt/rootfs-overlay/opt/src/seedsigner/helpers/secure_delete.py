"""Best-effort secure memory clearing for sensitive Python objects.

Python does not guarantee secure deletion of string or bytes data.
These helpers use ctypes to overwrite the internal buffer of bytearray
and (where possible) bytes objects before they are garbage-collected.

Limitations:
    - Immutable ``str`` and ``bytes`` objects may have been copied by the
      interpreter (interning, concatenation) so zeroing the original does
      not guarantee all copies are erased.
    - Only CPython is supported; other interpreters may lay out objects
      differently.
    - This is a *mitigation*, not a guarantee. A sufficiently privileged
      attacker with access to the process memory may still recover data.
